    我们可以通过以下特性来自定义过渡类名：<br />
    <ul>
      <li>enter-class </li>
      <li>enter-active-class</li>
      <li>leave-class</li>
      <li>leave-active-class</li>
    </ul>
    他们的优先级高于普通的类名，这对于 Vue 的过渡系统和其他第三方 CSS 动画库，如 Animate.css 结合使用十分有用。

  <div>
    <button @click="show = !show">Toggle render</button>
    <transition
      name="custom-classes-transition"
      enter-active-class="animated tada"
      leave-active-class="animated bounceOutRight"
    >
      <p v-if="show">
